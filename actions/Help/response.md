Ellipsis runs standup meetings for your team by asking people questions and building a summary for the team to see.  

**Getting started**  
1. Type `setup farm standup` in a message to Ellipsis. It will ask you a few questions.
1. You are done!

**Using it**  
Once setup is complete, every week at the check-in time, Ellipsis will privately message each member of the #standup channel (or whatever channel you chose during setup) and ask questions.

At publishing time, Ellipsis will print a report with everyone's answers to the standup channel.
